IoT Based Otopark System

The IoT-based Smart Parking System aims to optimize and enhance parking processes in major cities and crowded areas. By assisting drivers in quickly locating suitable parking spaces, it saves time and reduces traffic congestion. Moreover, the system facilitates more efficient utilization of parking facilities, thereby optimizing urban management. An IoT-enabled mobile application developed specifically for users accelerates and simplifies the discovery of vacant parking spaces, minimizing search times. This initiative aims to address urban parking challenges and promote sustainable transportation systems. In this context, the IoT-based Smart Parking System is seen as a significant step towards improving daily life for drivers while enhancing urban traffic management and environmental sustainability.
